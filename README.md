Here, some notions :

- Creating a react app structurre easily

- JSX
- virtual DOM
- The Components
- The Props
- The children props
- The state
- The life chronotimer on a component
- setState, what's it ? ;)
- The events in react
- Conditions
- Send data to parent component
- Loops in react
- Fragments
- Adding style on a component
- Changing style on Hover
- Adding CSS in react component
- CSS modules
